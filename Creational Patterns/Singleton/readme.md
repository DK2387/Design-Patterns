# Creational Design Patterns
Creational design patterns are a set of design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.
They provide flexibility in object creation, helping to make a system independent of how it's objects are created, composed and represented.

Following are the example of Creational Design Patterns:
1) Singleton Pattern.
2) Factory Method Pattern.
3) Abstract Factory Pattern.
4) Builder Pattern.
5) Prototype Pattern
6) Object Pool Pattern.
